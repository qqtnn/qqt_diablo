You can find here some of the QQT LUA Plugins aswell, either official rotations or some other plugins popular enough to gain an spot here.

To download and use a plugin you have to make sure you place it inside /scripts/ folder next to your loader.
If you dont see the folder you can create it yourself then place the folder containings the luas inside.
For example: qqt_loader_folder/scripts/barbarian_rotation/ inside this folder you should at least have main.lua which is the first fime core will try to find to load.
